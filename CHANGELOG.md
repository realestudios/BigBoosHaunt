### 2.2.0

- Splashing sounds caused some networking issues, so they have been removed

- Scrap is now part of this mod, no need for the SM64 Scrap mod

### 2.1.0

- Changed elevator logic entirely. It cannot carry scrap, so don't drop your scrap on it yet. It's bumpy, so hold on tight. At least it moves this time

- Water splashing sounds have been added in the basement

- Removed interior lights that didn't need to be there. Use a flashlight if you plan to venture in the original interior (this should fix the error from too many shadows being requested)

- Adjusted new scrap spawns


### 2.0.0

- Custom scrap added! More to follow soon

- Elevator should be able to support more than one person now

- Game will no longer freeze for a half a second while the dropship spawns

### 1.1.0

- Added back the moving platform! It should stay on track now. Revert to version 1.0.2 or 0.6.1 if it is still broken

- Boo sfx will no longer play in the mansion

- Changed icon

### 1.0.2

- Removed the moving platform. Needs more testing

### 1.0.1

Hotfix:

- Removed extra fog

- Fixed some weird doorknob placements

### 1.0.0

- Supplemented ladder to the basement with a moving platform (currently very delicate, so the ladder will remain if it goes off track)

- Added original door models (the doors that can open warp the doorknobs a bit. Will investigate later)

- Added Boo sfx in the background

- Changed lighting to be much cooler to match the original game better

- Proper footstep sounds

- Properly functioning water in the bigger pool, plus a ladder so you can escape the water with no stamina

- Changed water texture to be translucent 

Still looking into splashing sounds when walking through the shallow water without hindering movement.
